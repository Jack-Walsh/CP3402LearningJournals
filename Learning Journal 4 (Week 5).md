**Estimated Hours**  
I have spent an estimate 5-6 hours this week working on setting up delpoyment for a locally hosted website with VVV.

**Content Insights**  
I understand the benefit of implementing the 3 environments - Staging, Local and Production. I am still learning how to set this up correctly so that I can work on the site from anywhere.

**Career/Employability/Learning Insights**  
I did find that there are a lot of different ways to install and run a local environment. This can make it tricky to find the right fit. It takes consistent trial and error to get it right sometimes.
