## **Practical 11**  

#### **Learning Activities**  
To complete our group project we utilised Local (by Flywheel) and Flywheel services to host our site with our local, staging, and production environments. As one of my roles was to configure this, I had to spend time learning how to push our sites from environment to environment while allowing all of our team members to access and edit the site. To accomplish this, I watched tutorials on how to correctly push and pull our site including the database. As part of the theme development I wanted to ensure we were covering all parts of the template/theme, so to assist me with this I watched YouTube tutorials.  

There were also other moments throughout the project where I wanted to implement a particular element or couldn't figure out how to design an element on the site, so I was required to watch tutorials and read up as much as I could to learn about them. Examples of this was configuring the navigation bar and adding unique styles to it, same with the footer and adding different divs and aligning them correctly.

#### **Estimated Hours**  
Over the last couple weeks of completing this subject I spent an estimated 10 hours learning course content and learning material relevant to assisting me in resolving issues to complete the group project and presentation.

#### **Content Insights**  
Throughout the last two weeks I have learnt how to confiure hosting for a site and work between multiple environments. I understand the importance of implementing such environments particularly when working in a group. It aims to create a seemless and hopefully fault free workflow, allowing people to work remotely. It really helped a team of 4, located all over the state of QLD work together and manage eachothers work well.  

My first impressions of designing a custom theme for a website was - "its difficult and would take ages to complete". I think I thought this because of the professionalism of the different custom themes available on WordPress. After working on this theme and working our way through each component and understanding the workflow of the theme I can see how with time we could most definitely build professional looking themes.  

It was also really great to see how GitHub, PHP Storm and our local platform Local could all be connected together. It made our workflow with each member so much smoother and this is definitely an option I will always put forward in the future if I was to complete a project like this.

#### **Career/Employability/Learning Insights**  
Gaining this experience of CMS development with different environments has definitely upskilled me for future possibilities of working in the web development industry. I believe it is one thing to be proficient in CSS, HTML, PHP or JavaScript but to be able to work collaboratively within a team, managing version control and the different stages of development is the next level to employability within web development.  

Going back to the CSS and HTML though, I have gained a strong understanding over the last couple weeks and throughout this subject of how these two work and how to do them well. I think if I was to pursue a career in this industry I have laid a solid foundation that could potentially help me land a junior web developer role or at least has given me the confidence to apply. There is a lot more to learn but this project has provided many skills for me take away.
