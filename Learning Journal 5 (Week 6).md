# CP3402 Learning Journals
### **Week 6**  


**Learning Activities**  
This week I worked on setting up the communications and project management platforms for the group project. These were then integrated into slack to receive real time notifications of commits and alerts. As a group we spent time meeting and getting to know eachother as well as planning the intial set up of our project. This included discussing how we were going to complete the project and which resources we would use.


**Resources/Links**
This last week I watched the LinkedIn Learning course: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/agile-at-work-driving-productive-agile-meetings/having-daily-stand-up-meetings-2?u=2223545


**Estimated Hours**  
I spent an estimated 3-4 hours meeting with the team and setting up the project management resources.


**Content Insights**  
It was neat to see how Slack, Trello and Github can all be integrated. I can see how this would make project management streamlined in the workforce and allow teams to complete an arrange of projects well organised.


**Career/Employability/Learning Insights**  
When using products such as Slack, Github or any Atlassian product it is a good idea to integrate the programs together.
