# CP3402 Learning Journals
### **Week 6**  


**Learning Activities**  
This week I have worked on setting up all the communications and project management platforms for the group project. These were then integrated into slack to receive real time notifications of commits and alerts. As a group we spent time meeting and planning the intial set up of our project as well.


**Resources/Links**
I watched the LinkedIn Learning course: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/agile-at-work-driving-productive-agile-meetings/having-daily-stand-up-meetings-2?u=2223545


**Estimated Hours**  
This week I spent an estimated 3-4 hours meeting with the team and setting up the project management resources.


**Content Insights**  
It was neat to see how Slack, Trello and Github can all be integrated. This makes project management very streamlined in the workforce.
