# CP3402 Learning Journals
### **Week 1 & 2**  


**Learning Activities**  
Over the last two weeks I have watched two LinkedIn Learning courses Introduction to Web Design and Development and WordPress Essential Training. I also spent time reviewing simple tutorials on W3Schools as I worked through the practical.

**Estimated Hours**  
I spent an estimated 11-12 hours over the last two weeks learning the course resources and completing the first practical.  


**Content Insights**  
I revised and now understand again how to create grids with columns and rows to structure content. I learned that ChatGPT is an incredible tool for helping achieve a solid foundation to develop ideas and further build on simple content. 

**Career/Employability/Learning Insights**  
I found watching the videos on a faster speed during sections where I already knew the content helped to be more productive but still get that refresher in. I found working on the content and practical steadily and consistently has helped to absorb more information.
