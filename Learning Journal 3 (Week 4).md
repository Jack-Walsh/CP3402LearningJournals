**Estimated Hours**  
I spent an estimated 6-7 hours over the last week learning the course resources and finalising the direction I want to take for the first assignment in terms of hosting options and CMS's.


**Content Insights**  
I learned how simple it is to implement a hosting option such as Lightsail. I have spent alot of time considering hosting plans but once you have an account created with AWS. It takes seconds to have Joomla and Wordpress both installed.


**Career/Employability/Learning Insights**  
This week I spent alot of time watching back through lectures and tutorials to really process the content provided. This helped guide me in the direction I needed for A1. I find that this is a useful process for me when I have a lot of subjects to focus on as it helps to recap important content.
