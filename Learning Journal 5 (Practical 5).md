#### **Estimated Hours**  
3-4 hours.

#### **Content Insights**  
The main thing I took away from learning about child themes is that you can make modifications to the css of the child theme while still keeping the parent theme intact. It is an important workflow to implement because the parent themes can receive updates such as bug fixes, security patches, or new features. By using a child theme, I can make updates to the parent theme without losing any customizations.

#### **Career/Employability/Learning Insights**  
Following on from above, working between child and parent themes and having the skill to be able to work like this and understand why, would be beneficial in a web development role.
