### **Practical 8**  


**Learning Activities**  
For my learning experiment, I have relied on other subjects that I am currently enrolled in and my overall approach to my studies. Over the last 1-2 weeks, I have become quite busy in my personal life taking up valuable time from my usual faily cleared study schedule.  

Recognising early that over the next couple weeks this would be the case, I decided to test the theory of focusing and understanding my briefs, topics and rubrics and working in a backwards learning style to find the content I needed to answer what was assessed. The aim of this test was to discover whether this approach would assist in reducing my study load over the two weeks while my available time was limited, whether this could work throughout an entire semester, and still achieve a grade to be proud of.

Firstly, I had a maths test that I needed to study for that was approaching quickly. I decided to look at what the test was assessing and focus on this content leading into the test.

Secondly, I had an assignment due for another subject shortly after the test. This made it difficult to split my time efficiently, ensuring I had enough to give to both subjects.

Thirdly, I had to ensure I was still making time to stay on top of other subjects and tasks.

Throughout the two weeks, this theory was holding up. I was achieving the study I needed in order to complete the assessment and I did successfully complete each task on time. However, during the test and the time writing the report, I did find myself short or shallow in my knowledge. Having to spend additional and unplanned time, either working on the one question in the math test or searching for further information while writing the report that I probably should have already known. 

Unfortunately, at the time of writing this test result, I can not provide an assignmnet grade to support my result as I will not receive this until later. 

Overall, I can state this method of learning is a success in achieving the study for assessed items on time during a full schedule. I am not confident to conclude that the depth of knowledge obtained throughout this last 1-2 weeks may show my best work possible.

**Career/Employability/Learning Insights**  
After working like this the last couple of weeks, I will be moving back to my original study plan of completing all content, and working through the study material in a systematic fashion. Not only does this create better foundations for your knowledge to build on, it helps to create a regular and strict study schedule that will overall help improve results.

I understand that sometimes in the work force times like this can happen and you only have a limited amount of time on a task and all you can do is focus on what will help you get through. It is definitely a balance but I think adopting this specific content method and a stricter, systematic method and being able to adapt within situations by moving between the two will help.
