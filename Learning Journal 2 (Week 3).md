# CP3402 Learning Journals
### **Week 3**  


**Learning Activities**  
The past week, I completed a LinkedIn Learning coruse and a "How to build a website with Joomla 4", to familiarise myself with the basics of Joomla.  (Joomla Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5VZwTLdgdM)  
I also spent time reading through the Joomla Template Docs: https://docs.joomla.org/Portal:Template_Management

**Resources/Links**  
WordPress Workflows: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-workflows-2015/welcome?autoplay=true&u=2223545

**Estimated Hours**  
I spent an estimated 5-6 hours over the last week learning the course resources and completing the second practical on Joomla.  


**Content Insights**  
It was good to see how powerful Joomla is, there are plenty of extensions and templates available to plugin. I need to spend more time learning about how to customise templates to fully customise and personalise a site.

**Career/Employability/Learning Insights**  
I don't have any specific Career/Employability/Learning insights. I spent alot of time learning and configuring Joomla.
